# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Learning Objectives.
General Objectives

#### * Who is Guido van Rossum
Is the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life "What's this title?") creator of Python, ex Google Developer and Dropbox dev.
#### * Why indentation is so important in Python
Indentation is the way of visually organize the code. But, also, indentation represents the order of reading, especially in clauses. It saves the use of clauses
#### * How to use the if, if ... else statements
if is used as plain english. When ends the declaration, the clause ends with : and the function inside is indented
else if is written as elif
else is ended with :
#### * How to use comments
Comments can be with # symbol, single quotes, double quotes or three times quotes. Quotes are Docstrings and is a good practice to put there
#### * How to affect values to variables

#### * How to use the while and for loops
While is pretty similar to C\
For loops have many different ways to use. From ´´´for in´´´ to ´´´for in range()´´´. Also, can be used with else clause
#### * How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
In C, for clauses have a halt condition. Python automatically stops in range
#### * How to use the break and continues statements
´´´break´´´ and ´´´continue´´´ statements works as in C. Works when breaks a loop in an specific condition, or continue at other case
#### * How to use else clauses on loops
In C, implicit else clauses are used out of the looop. On Python, the else clause implies that for loop is a constant boolean iteration. If all clauses are falses, goes to the else statement
#### * What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
Pass is used when a function or object are uncomplete. Basically, pass defines a "Don't do that"
#### * How to use range
range starts a loop from the first parameter until the second parameter, unincluded. A third parameter can be included, that indicates how much the increment will be
#### * What is a function and how do you use functions
Function is a
#### * What does return a function that does not use any return statement
#### * Scope of variables
#### * What’s a traceback
#### * What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Work log.

##### - Stacks and Queues
Python is a C based programming language, so it takes a compilation proccess on back. Through certain data structures, Python can reproduce an excellent example of Stack, through pop() method on lists
